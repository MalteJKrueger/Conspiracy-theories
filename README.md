# Conspiracy-theories
Here you can find my data from my surveys regarding the resilience of pupils against conspiracy theories. I used this data for my master thesis: A virus of narratives - Containment of Conspiracy theories through civic education

In the directory CSV Excel you can find the variables and values regarding my surveys.
For my master thesis I used R. 
The data regarding my first study can be found here: Conspiracy-theories/R/Datenberechnungen Hypothesen/Hypothese 1 - Resilienz/
There you'll find my R script for the first two hypotheses as well as the code for my boxplots for those hypotheses.

The data reagrding the survey experiment can be found under Datenaufbereitung Excel/SurveyExperiment.
