# Conspiracy-theories
Here you can find my data from my surveys regarding the resilience of pupils against conspiracy theories. I used this data for my master thesis: A virus of narratives - Containment of Conspiracy theories through civic education

In the directory CSV Excel you can find the variables and values regarding my surveys.
For my master thesis I used R but you can also find the data for other statistic programs. 
The data regarding my first study can be found here: Conspiracy-theories/R/Datenberechnungen Hypothesen/Hypothese 1 - Resilienz/
There you'll find my R script for the first two hypotheses as well as the code for my boxplots for those hypotheses.

The data reagrding the survey experiment can be found under Conspiracy-theories/Datenaufbereitung Excel/Survey Experiement/Survey Experiemnt R/
There you'll find my R script for all hypothesis reagrding the survey-experiment. 

The data for the OLS-regression can be found in the directory for the survey-experiment.

The scripts give you information which datasets I used for every calculation. Those datasets can be found in the same directories.

If you have questions regarding the data or if there is something missing please contact me: stu112389@mail.uni-kiel.de
